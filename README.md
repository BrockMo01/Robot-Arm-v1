This is my first attempt at a robotic arm and will be used as a launch pad for future robotic arm projects. I can already see some limitations of this project due to the chosen hardware but that is a problem for another project.

Materials used:
- Arduino Uno
- 4x Micro Servos
- 3D printed parts (.stl included)
